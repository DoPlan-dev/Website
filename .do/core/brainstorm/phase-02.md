   - How do their needs differ?

3. **What are the user personas?**
   - Create 2-3 detailed personas
   - What are their goals, frustrations, motivations?

4. **Who are the main competitors?**
   - Direct and indirect competitors
   - What do they do well? What are their weaknesses?

5. **How do we differentiate?**
   - What unique features or approaches set us apart?
   - What can we do better than competitors?

6. **What are the user's current alternatives?**
   - How do they solve this problem today?
