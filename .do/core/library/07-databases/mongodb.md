# MongoDB Database Rules

## Schema Design
- Design schemas based on access patterns
- Embed related data when frequently accessed together
- Reference data when it changes independently
- Use indexes for frequently queried fields

## Queries
- Use projection to limit returned fields
- Use aggregation pipeline for complex queries
- Avoid large result sets
- Use pagination for large datasets

## Best Practices
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper error handling
- Use transactions for multi-document operations
- Monitor query performance

## Security
- Use authentication and authorization
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use SSL/TLS for connections
- Follow principle of least privilege
