# React Framework Rules

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use composition over inheritance

## State Management
- Use `useState` for local state
- Use `useReducer` for complex state
- Use Context API for shared state
- Consider Redux for global state

## Performance
- Use `React.memo` for expensive components
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` appropriately
- Implement code splitting
- Lazy load routes and components

## Best Practices
- Follow React hooks rules
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Write tests with React Testing Library
- Keep components pure when possible
