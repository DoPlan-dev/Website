# Plan: Hero Section

**Task ID**: 1.4  
**Status**: Draft  
**Phase**: 01-Foundation  
**Priority**: P0 - Must Have

## Objectives
- [ ] Design and implement hero section layout
- [ ] Create headline and subheadline components
- [ ] Implement 5 commands display
- [ ] Create terminal visual component
- [ ] Implement copy-to-clipboard button for install command
- [ ] Add command copy functionality with feedback
- [ ] Implement floating terminal animation
- [ ] Add background gradient effects
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Optimize for <1s load time

## Approach
Create an impressive hero section that immediately communicates DoPlan's value proposition. The section should:
- Display the 5 commands clearly (/hey, /do, /plan, /dev, /sys)
- Feature a floating terminal visual on desktop (right side)
- Include a prominent copy button for the install command
- Use cyberpunk minimalism aesthetic with dark theme
- Load in under 1 second

## Scope
- **In Scope**: 
  - Hero layout (50-50 split desktop, single column mobile)
  - Terminal visual component with 3D perspective
  - Copy-to-clipboard functionality
  - Background gradient effects
  - Responsive design
- **Out of Scope**: 
  - Video backgrounds
  - Complex animations (keep simple for performance)

## Dependencies
- Design system tokens (colors, typography)
- Base layout components
- Clipboard API access

## Timeline
- **Start**: Day 1 (MVP)
- **Target Completion**: Day 1 (MVP)
- **Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Terminal animation might impact performance → **Mitigation**: Use CSS transforms, test on low-end devices
- **Risk**: Copy functionality might not work on all browsers → **Mitigation**: Use Clipboard API with fallback
