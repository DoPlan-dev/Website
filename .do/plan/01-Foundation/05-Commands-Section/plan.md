**Phase**: 01-Foundation  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: P0 - Must Have  
**Estimated Time**: 5-6 hours

## Objectives

Create an interactive section that explains the 5 sacred DoPlan commands (/hey, /do, /plan, /dev, /sys) with clear explanations, visual hierarchy, and engaging interactions. This section helps visitors understand the workflow and value proposition.

**Key Goals:**
- [ ] Create command cards component
- [ ] Design interactive command cards

- [ ] Add command explanations
- [ ] Create visual hierarchy for commands
- [ ] Implement scroll animations (fade-in)
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness

## Approach

**Component Strategy:**
1. Create command card component for each of the 5 commands
2. Design cards with icon, command name, description, and examples
3. Implement hover effects (glow, lift, border intensification)
4. Add scroll-triggered fade-in animations
5. Create visual hierarchy showing command relationships
6. Ensure responsive grid layout

**File Structure:**
- `src/components/sections/CommandsSection.tsx` - Main section component
- `src/components/ui/CommandCard.tsx` - Individual command card
- `src/components/ui/CommandIcon.tsx` - Command icon component
