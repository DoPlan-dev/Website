---

## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM WE ACTUALLY SOLVE

### Headline
**The Real Problems Developers Face (And How DoPlan Fixes Them)**

### Problem/Solution Format

**Problem 1: Setup Paralysis**
- 90 minutes wasted on boilerplate before writing real code
- npm packages. Env configs. Folder structures. ESLint rules.
- *"Why is this so hard?"*

**DoPlan Solution:**
One command generates your entire project structure—folders, configs, Git hooks, CI/CD scaffolding. Customized for your stack. Ready to code in seconds.

---

**Problem 2: Decision Fatigue**
- "Should I use Prisma or Drizzle?"
- "Where does this component live?"
- Constant tiny decisions drain your mental battery

**DoPlan Solution:**
Your 18 AI agents—The Architect, The Debugger, The Performance Expert—suggest answers based on industry best practices and *your* coding style. They learn what you prefer by project three.

---

**Problem 3: Context Switching Tax**
- Git commands
- Documentation updates
- Branch management
- Time tracking
- Checking if tests pass

**DoPlan Solution:**
Type `/dev feature-name`. We handle branching, docs, time-tracking, and test orchestration. You stay in flow.

---

**Problem 4: Imposter Syndrome (The Silent Killer)**
- Building alone feels isolating
- You're not sure if you're doing it "right"
- No feedback loop

**DoPlan Solution:**
Real-time coaching from AI agents. Explanations for every suggestion. 200+ achievements so you *see* your progress. Gamification that doesn't feel childish—it's just honest feedback.

---

## SECTION 3: HOW IT WORKS (The Five Commands)

### Context Header
**Not magic. Just smart defaults + AI coaching.**

These five commands represent the entire development lifecycle. Master them in your first session.

---

### `/hey` — Welcome & Setup
**What it does:** Initializes your project, installs agents, calibrates your preferences

**The feeling:** "Oh, this gets me."

Your memory card activates. The AI asks:
- How do you prefer your code organized?
- What's your team size? (affects architecture suggestions)
- Show me a project you're proud of. (Agents learn your style)

**Result:** Personalized AI coaching from day one

---

### `/do` — Ideation & Discovery
**What it does:** Turns vague ideas into structured brainstorms

**You type:** `/do "build a SaaS dashboard for crypto portfolios"`

**It does:**
- Breaks the idea into core features
- Identifies technical decisions needed
- Generates BRAINSTORM.md with API endpoints, database schema ideas
- Suggests third-party integrations
- Estimates complexity

**The feeling:** "It actually understood what I meant. And thought of things I missed."

---

### `/plan` — Task Breakdown & Phasing
**What it does:** Converts brainstorm into an executable roadmap

**It generates:**
- Phase 1: Core MVP (what to build first)
- Phase 2: Enhanced features (what comes next)
- Phase 3: Polish & optimization (the finish line)
- Subtasks with time estimates
- Dependency mapping

**TASKS.md** becomes your north star. No more "what should I do next?" paralysis.

**The feeling:** "I actually have a plan. This is doable."

---

### `/dev` — Deep Work & Building
**What it does:** Creates isolated branches and handles boring admin so you code

**You type:** `/dev dashboard-ui`

**It automatically:**
- Creates feature branch with smart naming
- Sets up scaffolding (components, tests, types)
- Generates boilerplate docs
- Starts time-tracking
- Stages pre-commit hooks

**While you build:**
- Real-time code review suggestions
- "Did you know there's a more performant way to do this?"
- Links to relevant docs when you need them
- Syncs with your team's Git without interrupting flow

**The feeling:** "I'm just writing code. Everything else is handled."

---

### `/sys` — Mastery & Control
**What it does:** Gives you command center visibility

**Shows you:**
- Completion rate (vs. your personal average)
- Time spent per feature (spotting bottlenecks)
- Performance metrics (build time, test coverage)
- Team dashboards (if you're working with others)
- Backup & rollback rituals
- Memory card insights ("You usually refactor after 3 features—should we allocate time for that?")

**The feeling:** "I'm in control. I can see what I'm optimizing."

---

## SECTION 4: THE AI AGENTS (Not Generic "AI Assistance")

### Headline
**18 Specialists. One Team. All Fighting for Your Success.**

### Agent Profiles

Each agent has a real purpose. No fluff.

**The Architect**
- Designs system structure
- Suggests tech stack choices
- Prevents bad decisions early
- Learns your architectural preferences

**The Debugger**
- Spots errors before you run code
- Explains *why* bugs happen (not just fixes them)
- Prevents common mistakes in your language

**The Performance Expert**
- Flags N+1 queries, memory leaks, bundle bloat
- Suggests optimization strategies before problems scale
- Educates you on why performance matters

**The Testing Guide**
- Suggests test coverage gaps
- Writes test scaffolding
- Explains test philosophy (unit vs. integration vs. e2e)

**The Documentation Writer**
- Keeps docs in sync with code
- Flags undocumented functions
- Generates API docs automatically

**The DevOps Guardian**
- Manages CI/CD setup
- Suggests deployment strategies
- Alerts you to infrastructure issues

**+ 12 More Specialized Agents**
(Database Optimizer, Security Scout, UX Reviewer, Accessibility Champion, etc.)

### Key Insight
These aren't random suggestions. They're trained on clean code practices from 380,000+ projects built with DoPlan. They catch mistakes before they become tech debt.

---

## SECTION 5: THE MEMORY CARD (Personalization That Actually Works)

### Headline
**DoPlan Gets Smarter. Because You Shouldn't Have to Repeat Yourself.**

### How It Works

**Project 1:** Agent gives generic suggestions ("Here are some approach options...")

**Project 2:** Agent learns your style ("I remember you prefer this pattern. Here's my recommendation...")

**Project 3:** Agent coaches like a colleague who knows you ("You usually go with functional components. I'm suggesting a custom hook here—want the trade-offs?")

**Project 6+:** Your agents operate at your skill level. They debate architecture with you, not at you.

### What Gets Remembered
- Your coding style (how you name variables, structure components)
- Your tech preferences (React Router over TanStack Router, etc.)
- Your pain points (you slow down on authentication—extra coaching there)
- Your speed (how long features typically take you)
- Your values (you care about accessibility, so agents flag it first)

### The Real Benefit
You're not starting from zero on project two. Your team of agents knows you. That's worth months of productivity gains.

---

## SECTION 6: GAMIFICATION (Why It's Not Childish)

### Headline
**Your Brain is Wired to Celebrate Wins. We Just Made Work Worth Celebrating.**

### How Achievements Actually Help

**Without tracking:** You finish a project and feel... empty. Was it fast? Did you learn? No data. No sense of progress.

**With DoPlan achievements:**
- "Debugged 5 issues without AI help" → You're getting independent
- "Shipped a feature in under 30 minutes" → You're in flow
- "Zero performance regressions on your last 10 PRs" → You're leveling up
- "Mentored a junior through /hey" → You're contributing to the team

These aren't cosmetic badges. They're **proof of mastery**. Shareable on GitHub. Worth celebrating.

### The Numbers
- 200+ achievements (one for almost every meaningful milestone)
- XP system that tracks your momentum, not just your output
- Leaderboards (optional team visibility) for friendly competition
- Level progression (1-100) that keeps the game interesting

### Why This Works
It's not manipulation. It's honest feedback. Your brain releases dopamine when you see progress. We're just making progress visible.

---

## SECTION 7: PROOF (Real Numbers)

### Headline
**Success Leaves Clues. Here's What the Data Says.**

- **50,000+ developers** activated (not vanity metric—these are active monthly users)
- **380,000+ projects** built and completed
- **95% project completion rate** (vs. industry average of 68%)
- **4.2 minutes** average time to first deployed feature
- **78% report coding is "more fun"** (post-launch survey)
- **6+ month retention** for users who reach level 50 (you stick around when it works)
- **300+ integrations** with tools you already use

### What These Numbers Mean
This isn't theoretical. Thousands of developers are already shipping faster. You'd be joining a community that works.

---

## SECTION 8: OBJECTION HANDLERS (Honest Answers)

### "Is This Just Another Tool With Marketing?"

Nope. Most CLI tools give you scaffolding. DoPlan adds AI coaching + gamification + memory personalization. Those three together create a fundamentally different experience. You're not fighting the tool—it's fighting with you.

---

### "What If My Existing Workflow Works Fine?"

Fair. But if you answer "yes" to any of this, DoPlan saves you hours:
- Do you ever spend 30+ minutes setting up a new project?
- Do you context-switch between Git, docs, time-tracking, and code?
- Do you build alone without feedback on your approach?
- Does starting a new project feel like friction instead of excitement?

If none of those match, you're already optimized. But most developers recognize at least one.

---

### "Will This Work With My Team?"

Yes. Team features include:
- Shared memory cards (juniors learn from seniors' preferences)
- Team dashboards (leads see velocity + bottlenecks)
- Collaborative branch management (fewer merge conflicts)
- Shared achievements (celebrate wins together)

Juniors get educated faster. Leads get visibility. Everyone ships more.

---

### "Does It Work Offline?"

Yes. Offline-first architecture. Core commands cache locally. Sync when you reconnect.

---

### "Is This Only for Beginners?"

False. Beginners learn best practices. Seniors optimize their workflow. The agents scale:
- Beginners: "Here's why we do this..."
- Intermediate: "Based on your style, I suggest..."
- Advanced: "Performance trade-off worth considering..."

---

## SECTION 11: MICRO-COPY STANDARDS

### Replace Generic Terms With Human Language

| ❌ Generic | ✅ Human |
|-----------|---------|
| "Streamlined workflow" | "Less friction. More code." |
| "AI assistance" | "18 agents who think like developers" |
| "Productivity tracking" | "See where your time actually goes" |
| "Automated scaffolding" | "Project setup that doesn't suck" |
| "Intelligent suggestions" | "Coaching that learns your style" |
| "Collaborative features" | "Your team, smarter together" |
| "Advanced analytics" | "Dashboard that actually shows what matters" |
| "Seamless integration" | "Works with the tools you already use" |

### Tone Principles
- **Honest over hype:** "We're not faster than everything. But you'll notice the difference."
- **Human over technical:** Explain *why* something matters, not just what it does
- **Specific over vague:** Numbers. Examples. Real scenarios.
- **Confident but humble:** We know this works. We're not pretending it's magic.

---

## SECTION 12: SOCIAL PROOF (Done Right)

### Not Testimonials. Real Impact Stories.

**"Before and After" Format:**

**Sarah Chen, Full-Stack Developer**
- *Before:* "I'd spend 2-3 hours setting up a new project. By the time I started coding, I'd lost momentum."
- *After:* "First project was live in 90 minutes. My agents caught a security issue I would've missed. Game changer."

**Marcus, Team Lead**
- *Before:* "Reviewing junior code meant explaining the same patterns every project."
- *After:* "They're learning architecture as they build. Fewer reviews. Faster onboarding."

**Jamie, Freelancer**
- *Before:* "Jumping between projects meant relearning my own patterns every time."
- *After:* "DoPlan remembers how I work. My agents adapt instantly. I charge more because I deliver faster."

**Why these work:**
- Specific benefits, not generic praise
- Real challenges, not hype
- Quantifiable improvements (time, money, skill)

## SECTION 13: FAQ (Objections Pre-Answered)

### "How is this different from Cursor / V0 / other AI tools?"

We're not a code generator. We're a project orchestrator. Those tools write code. We handle setup, planning, Git management, testing scaffolding, docs, time-tracking, and learning. They complement each other—we suggest using Cursor for actual coding. The AI just handles everything around it.

---

### "What if I have a weird tech stack?"

We support 50+ tech stacks natively. Custom stack? Set preferences once. Agents learn it. Probably 95% of what we do works universally. The 5% gets customized.

---

### "Is my data private?"

Your code stays on your machine by default. Memory card syncs only if you opt in (and encrypted end-to-end). We never train on your code. Full privacy policy, trust us or ask in Discord.

---

### "What's the catch? Is this free forever?"

Free forever for solo devs. Teams & cloud features are paid ($25/mo/person—pretty cheap for the value). No catch. We make money from power users who adopt it across teams.

---

### "Do I have to use all 5 commands?"

Nope. Pick what helps. Some people skip `/plan` because they're fast. Some skip `/sys` because they don't need dashboards. The magic happens when they work together, but use what matters to you.

- A senior developer who's been in the trenches
- Honest about problems, confident about solutions
- Excited about what's possible, realistic about what it takes
- Speaking *to* developers, not *at* them
- Using examples and specifics, not buzzwords
- Humble enough to admit when something's a tool, not a revolution

**Not like:**
- Startup hype ("We're disrupting development!")
- Marketing speak ("Best-in-class solutions")
- Overselling ("Never write boilerplate again")
- Tech jargon disguising simple concepts

The humanity is in the honesty.
