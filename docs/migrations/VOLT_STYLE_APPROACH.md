# Matching PrimeVue Volt Design Style

## Overview

PrimeVue Volt (https://volt.primevue.org/) is a Vue.js component library, so we can't use it directly in our React project. However, we can match their design aesthetic and styling approach.

## Volt Design Characteristics

Based on the Volt homepage:

1. **Clean & Professional**
   - Minimal, serious aesthetic
   - Professional spacing
   - Subtle colors
   - Clean borders

2. **Component Style**
   - 50+ components
   - Tailwind CSS v4 based
   - Accessible (WCAG compliant)
   - Fully customizable

3. **Visual Design**
   - Clean white backgrounds
   - Professional typography
   - Subtle shadows
   - Minimal borders

## Our Approach

Since we're using React (not Vue), we can:

### Option 1: Keep Radix UI + Match Volt Aesthetic ✅ Recommended
- Use Radix UI components (already installed, React-compatible)
- Style with Tailwind CSS to match Volt's look
- Match their spacing, colors, and typography
- Professional, clean design

### Option 2: Use React Alternatives
- shadcn/ui (React components, Tailwind-based)
- Chakra UI (React component library)
- Mantine (React component library)

### Option 3: Custom Components
- Build custom components matching Volt's design
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- More control but more work

## Recommendation

**Keep Radix UI** and style it to match Volt's aesthetic:
- ✅ Already installed and working
- ✅ React-compatible
- ✅ Professional design
- ✅ Accessible
- ✅ We can customize styling to match Volt

We can update:
1. Colors to match Volt's palette
2. Spacing to match Volt's scale
3. Component styling to match Volt's look
4. Typography to match Volt's style

This gives us the best of both worlds - React compatibility with Volt's aesthetic!
