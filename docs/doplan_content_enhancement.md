# DoPlan CLI Website Content Enhancement Guide

## Strategic Enhancements

### 1. Hero Section Upgrades

**Current Strength:** Atmospheric and mysterious
**Enhancement:** Add social proof + benefit clarity

```
EXISTING:
"Enter the Temple of Code. In 2049, development is a ritual..."

ENHANCED VERSION:
"Enter the Temple of Code.
In 2049, development is a ritual—not a grind.

Join 50,000+ developers who've already transformed their workflow.
DoPlan CLI: Your key to the forbidden—turning chores into quests.

One Command. Five Sacred Words. Infinite Possibilities.
npx @doplan-dev/cli"
```

**Why:** Numbers build credibility. "Not a grind" directly addresses pain point.

---

### 2. Value Proposition Clarity

**Add Benefit Pyramid before the 4 cards:**

```
WHAT YOU GET (Subheading with glow effect)

⚡ 5 SECONDS → Full project structure, AI agents awake, ready to code
🎮 GAMIFIED → 200+ achievements unlock as you build (dopamine loops)
🧠 18 AGENTS → Each specialized, teaching best practices in real-time
💾 MEMORY CARD → Remembers your style, adapts, gets smarter with every project
🚀 80-90% FASTER → Production apps in hours, not weeks
```

**Why:** Scannable. Quantified. Emotional + logical balance.

---

### 3. Enhanced Feature Cards (Doctrine Section)

**Card 1: The Single Command Doctrine** (Keep as-is, it's perfect)

**Card 2: Five Sacred Words** (ENHANCE)
```
CURRENT:
"/hey (awaken), /do (envision), /plan (forge), /dev (build), /sys (master)..."

ENHANCED:
"/hey → Your IDE awakens to guided tutorials & best practices
/do → Capture ideas through AI-powered discovery & ideation
/plan → Transform visions into phased, hierarchical task blueprints
/dev → Build features with auto-branch creation, docs, time-tracking
/sys → God-mode: metrics, backups, memory, performance tuning

Learn once. Flow forever. Muscle memory in minutes."
```

**Card 3: Why More Commands Kill the Magic** (REFRAME)
```
CURRENT:
"Extra commands breed confusion..."

ENHANCED:
"Command Overload Is the Enemy.
Every extra command steals your focus, splits your attention, kills momentum.

DoPlan's brutal simplification means:
✓ Zero context-switching
✓ Instant muscle memory
✓ Marketing gold: 'Built an app with 5 commands—WTF'
✓ Cognitive space for what matters: Your code, your creativity"
```

**Card 4: Hidden Depths of Power** (ADD SPECIFICITY)
```
CURRENT:
"Complexity concealed like cult mysteries..."

ENHANCED:
"Surface Sacred. Depths Divine.

/dev silently handles:
→ Smart Git branch creation & management
→ Real-time sync with team projects
→ Documentation auto-generation
→ Time tracking & productivity metrics

/sys reveals:
→ Performance dashboards
→ Backup & rollback rituals
→ Memory card management
→ Team analytics & insights

No clutter. Just revealed when needed."
```

### 4. Features Page Deep-Dive Enhancements

**Add Context Headers Before Each Section:**

#### Before "The Five Eternal Commands"
```
THE RITUAL UNFOLDS IN FIVE ACTS

Each command is a phase of the development journey. Master them, and the temple is yours. They transform coding from a chore into an adventure—learning through play, building with joy.

→ Your first 5 minutes will teach you everything.
```

#### Before "The 18 Agents"
```
YOU DON'T CODE ALONE ANYMORE

Meet your inner circle—18 specialized AI agents that think like seasoned developers. They don't just assist; they educate. Every suggestion is a lesson. Every interaction raises your skill.

Hierarchical. Intentional. Always learning alongside you.
```

#### Before "Memory & Brain System"
```
THE TEMPLE LEARNS YOUR SECRETS

DoPlan remembers everything—your style, your preferences, your patterns. It adapts with each project. By project three, your AI agents know you better than you know yourself.

This is personalization at the level of magic."
```

#### Before "200+ Achievements"
```
EVERY MILESTONE MATTERS

Gamification isn't a gimmick here—it's the engine. Your brain's dopamine system is wired to celebrate wins. We weaponize that.

Achievement badges aren't just cosmetic. They're proof of mastery, shareable on GitHub, worthy of celebration."
```

### 9. New Component: "Objection Handlers" (Subtle FAQs)

```
WHISPERED DOUBTS ANSWERED

Q: "Is this just another tool with a theme?"
A: No. DoPlan fundamentally rewires how you code. The ritual isn't aesthetic—it's neurological. Gamification, AI coaching, and extreme simplification trigger focus states most tools can't achieve.

Q: "What about my existing workflow?"
A: /sys memory preserves your patterns. Agents learn your style within 3 projects. You're not adopting DoPlan—DoPlan adopts you.

Q: "Can my team use this?"
A: Absolutely. Share memory cards, auto-CI/CD, team achievements. Educational for juniors, empowering for leads. Junior gets taught best practices; lead gets visibility.

Q: "Does it work offline?"
A: Yes. Offline-first architecture. Core commands cache locally. Sync when connected.

Q: "Is this for beginners only?"
A: False. 1000+ rules serve everyone from newbies learning React to architects designing systems. The agents scale with your skill."
```

### 10. Footer/Secondary CTAs Enhancement

→ Star us on GitHub
→ Subscribe to dev rituals (weekly tips)

The temple will be here when you're ready.

```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **A/B Test the Hero** (with/without social proof)
2. **Heatmap the Features Page** (which cards get clicked most?)
3. **Measure Copy Engagement** (highlight word dwell time)
4. **Track CTA Clicks** (which button copy converts best?)
5. **Monitor Scroll Depth** (do users reach the objection handlers?)

---

## Tone Calibration

Keep the occult/cyberpunk mystique while:
- **Being More Direct** about benefits
- **Adding Specificity** (numbers, examples, workflows)
- **Reducing Vagueness** ("coding ritual" → "distraction-free focus state + AI coaching + gamification")
- **Building Credibility** (proof, use cases, testimonials)
- **Removing Gatekeeping** (it's exclusive-feeling, not actually exclusive)
