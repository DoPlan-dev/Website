## SECTION 1: WHY DOPLAN? (4 PILLARS)

### Pillar 1: Personalization 🤝
**"The Tool That Remembers & Adapts to You"**

- **Deepening Connection**: The more you use it, the more it gets to know you

**Example:**
- Day 1: "Hello. I'm DoPlan. Let's begin capturing your project idea."
- After 10 projects: "Hey! 👋 I'm DoPlan. Ready to capture your project idea?"

### How Your Detail Level Adapts

**Beginner Explanation:**
```
"I'll create a Git branch for you. A branch is like a separate workspace 
where you can make changes without affecting the main code. This is a 
best practice in software development that helps teams work together 
without conflicts."
```

**Advanced Explanation:**
```
"Creating branch task/2.1. Ready for development."
```

---

### How Your Help Adapts

**Gentle Error Handling:**
```
"I notice there was an issue. Don't worry, let's work through this together. 
Here's what happened and how we can fix it..."
```

**Educational Error Handling:**
```
"Error: Branch not found. This happens when you try to complete a task 
without starting one. Let me explain: when you run '/dev', DoPlan creates 
a branch for your task. You need to run '/dev' before '/done'. 
Would you like to start a task now?"
```
