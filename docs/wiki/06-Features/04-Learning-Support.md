## 🎓 What is Learning Support?

Learning Support in DoPlan provides:
- **Educational explanations** - Understand why, not just how
- **Learning goal tracking** - Set and track what you want to learn
- **Experience level adaptation** - Guidance matches your level
- **Pain point assistance** - Extra help where you struggle
- **Tech exploration** - Discover and learn new technologies

---

## 📚 Educational Explanations

### Beginner Mode

When experience level is "beginner":
- **Detailed explanations** - Why things work
- **Step-by-step guidance** - Clear instructions
- **Educational context** - Learning opportunities
- **Best practices** - Industry standards

**Example**:
```
"I'll create a Git branch for you. A branch is like a separate workspace 
where you can make changes without affecting the main code. This is a 
best practice in software development that helps teams work together 
without conflicts. When you're done, you can merge your branch back 
into the main code."
```

### Intermediate Mode

When experience level is "intermediate":
- **Balanced explanations** - Some detail, some efficiency
- **Context provided** - When needed
- **Best practices** - Highlighted
- **Efficient workflow** - Streamlined

**Example**:
```
"Creating branch task/2.1. This isolates your changes and makes code 
review easier. You can work on this feature independently."
```

### Advanced Mode

When experience level is "advanced":
- **Concise information** - Just what you need
- **Efficient communication** - Quick and direct
- **Power features** - Advanced options
- **Minimal explanation** - You know the basics

**Example**:
```
"Creating branch task/2.1. Ready for development."
```

## 💡 Learning Support Examples

### Example 1: First-Time API

**Scenario**: Using API for first time

**DoPlan Response**:
```
"I see you're creating an API for the first time! This is great for 
your learning goal 'Learn API design'. Let me explain:

An API (Application Programming Interface) allows different parts of 
your application to communicate. REST APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, 
PUT, DELETE) to perform operations.

Best practices:
- Use RESTful conventions
- Include proper error handling
- Document your endpoints
- Add authentication

This task will help you learn API design. I'll provide extra guidance 
as you work through it."
```

### Example 2: Database Migration Help

**Scenario**: User struggled with migrations before

**DoPlan Response**:
```
"I remember you've had trouble with database migrations before. Let me 
provide extra guidance:

1. Create migration file
2. Define schema changes
3. Test migration locally
4. Apply to database
5. Verify changes

Common pitfalls:
- Forgetting to test
- Not backing up data
- Missing rollback plan

I'll help you through each step. Don't hesitate to ask questions!"
```

### Example 3: New Technology

**Scenario**: Using TypeScript for first time

**DoPlan Response**:
```
"I see you're using TypeScript for the first time! This aligns with 
your learning goal 'Learn TypeScript'. 

TypeScript adds type safety to JavaScript, catching errors before 
runtime. Benefits:
- Better IDE support
- Fewer bugs
- Improved refactoring
- Better documentation

I'll provide TypeScript-specific guidance throughout this task. 
This is a great learning opportunity!"
