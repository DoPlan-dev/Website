```
DoPlan: "I'll create a Git branch for you. A branch is like a separate 
        workspace where you can make changes without affecting the main 
        code. This is a best practice in software development that helps 
        teams work together without conflicts.
        
        When you're done with your task, we'll merge this branch back 
        into the main code. This keeps the main code stable while you work."
```

## 💡 Common Beginner Questions

### "What is a Git branch?"

DoPlan explains:
```
"A Git branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes 
without affecting the main code. Think of it like making a copy of 
your project to experiment with. If something goes wrong, the main 
code is safe. When you're done and everything works, you merge your 
branch back into the main code."
```

### "What is a database?"

DoPlan explains:
```
"A database is like a digital filing cabinet for your application's 
data. Instead of storing data in files, you store it in a structured 
way that makes it easy to find, update, and delete. Popular databases 
include PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. Each has different strengths 
for different types of projects."
```

### "What is an API?"

DoPlan explains:
```
"An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a waiter in a 
restaurant. Your application (the customer) asks the API (the waiter) 
for something, and the API goes to the database (the kitchen) to get 
it, then brings it back to your application. APIs allow different 
parts of your application to communicate with each other."
```
