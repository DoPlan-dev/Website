## 🎯 What are Learning Goals?

Learning goals are what you want to learn:
- **Technologies** - TypeScript, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Concepts** - API design, database optimization
- **Skills** - Testing, deployment, security
- **Best practices** - Git workflows, CI/CD

---

## 📝 Setting Learning Goals

### During Onboarding

```bash
/hey
```

**What to do**:
- Set experience level
- Mention learning goals
- Choose learning focus
- Update preferences

**Example**:
```
DoPlan: "What would you like to learn?"
You: "I want to learn TypeScript and Docker"
```

### Through Conversation

```bash
/do
```

**What to do**:
- Mention learning goals in conversation
- Update as you learn
- Add new goals
- Track progress

**Example**:
```
You: "I want to build a project to learn TypeScript"
DoPlan: "Great! I'll make sure to provide TypeScript-specific guidance 
         and explanations throughout the project."
```

### In Memory Card
