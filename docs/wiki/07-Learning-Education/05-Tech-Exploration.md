## 🎯 What is Tech Exploration?

Tech exploration is discovering and learning new technologies:
- **Trying new tools** - Experiment with technologies
- **Learning as you build** - Educational support
- **Building diverse experience** - Multiple technologies
- **Earning achievements** - Tech exploration rewards

---

## 🔧 How Tech Exploration Works

### Automatic Detection

When you use a new technology:
- **Detected automatically** - From project context
- **Tracked in Memory Card** - Tech stack updated
- **Explanations provided** - Educational support
- **Achievements possible** - Tech Explorer, Tech Master

### Tech Stack Tracking

DoPlan tracks:
- **Technologies used** - Your tech stack
- **New technologies** - Exploration
- **Preferences** - What you like
- **Learning progress** - Skill growth

## 🎯 Tech Exploration Examples

### Example 1: First-Time TypeScript

**What happens**:
```
DoPlan: "I see you're using TypeScript for the first time! This aligns 
         with your learning goal 'Learn TypeScript'.
         
         TypeScript adds type safety to JavaScript, catching errors before 
         runtime. Benefits:
         - Better IDE support
         - Fewer bugs
         - Improved refactoring
         - Better documentation
         
         I'll provide TypeScript-specific guidance throughout this task. 
         This is a great learning opportunity!"
```

**Result**:
- TypeScript added to tech stack
- Learning goal progress
- Educational guidance
- Achievement: "Tech Explorer" (50 points)

### Example 2: First-Time Docker

**What happens**:
```
DoPlan: "I see you're using Docker for the first time! This is great 
         for your learning goal 'Master Docker'.
         
         Docker containerizes your application, making it easy to deploy 
         anywhere. Benefits:
         - Consistent environments
         - Easy deployment
         - Scalability
         - Isolation
         
         I'll provide Docker-specific guidance and best practices."
```

**Result**:
- Docker added to tech stack
- Learning goal progress
- Educational guidance
- Achievement: "Tech Explorer" (50 points)

### Example 3: First-Time Kubernetes

**What happens**:
```
DoPlan: "I see you're using Kubernetes for the first time! This is 
         advanced and aligns with your learning goal 'Understand Kubernetes'.
         
         Kubernetes orchestrates containers, managing deployment, scaling, 
         and operations. Benefits:
         - Automatic scaling
         - Self-healing
         - Load balancing
         - Resource management
         
         I'll provide Kubernetes-specific guidance. This is a significant 
         learning opportunity!"
```

**Result**:
- Kubernetes added to tech stack
- Learning goal progress
- Educational guidance
- Challenge: "Kubernetes Captain" (1,000 points)
