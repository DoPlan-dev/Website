### **Section 3: The Five Commands (Doctrine)**
**Goal:** Show the ritual in a way that feels accessible yet powerful

```
/hey → Your IDE awakens to guided tutorials & best practices
/do → Capture ideas through AI-powered discovery & ideation
/plan → Transform visions into phased, hierarchical task blueprints
/dev → Build features with auto-branch creation, docs, time-tracking
/sys → God-mode: metrics, backups, memory, performance tuning

Learn once. Flow forever. Muscle memory in minutes.
```

#### **Card 3: Command Overload Is the Enemy**
"Every extra command steals your focus, splits your attention, kills momentum.

DoPlan's brutal simplification means:
✓ Zero context-switching

✓ Cognitive space for what matters: Your code, your creativity"

#### **Card 4: Surface Sacred. Depths Divine.**
"/dev silently handles:
→ Smart Git branch creation & management

/sys reveals:
→ Performance dashboards
→ Backup & rollback rituals
→ Memory card management

No clutter. Just revealed when needed."

**Goal:** Remove friction without defensive tone

**Visual:** Expandable accordion or subtle card layout

```
Q: "Is this just another tool with a theme?"
A: No. DoPlan fundamentally rewires how you code. Gamification, AI coaching, and extreme simplification trigger focus states most tools can't achieve.

Q: "What about my existing workflow?"
A: /sys memory preserves your patterns. Agents learn your style within 3 projects.

Q: "Can my team use this?"
A: Yes. Share memory cards, auto-CI/CD, team achievements. Junior learns; lead gets visibility.

Q: "Does it work offline?"
A: Yes. Offline-first architecture with local caching.

Q: "Is this for beginners only?"
A: False. 1000+ rules serve everyone from React newbies to architects.

Q: "Will I be vendor-locked?"
A: No. Export your memory card, task data, and history anytime.
