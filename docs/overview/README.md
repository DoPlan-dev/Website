## Workflow

1. **Welcome** → Type /hello for first-time tutorial (new users)
2. **Idea** → Type /tell to capture your idea
3. **Meeting** → Type /meeting to start discovery meeting with the team
4. **Plan** → Type /write to generate all planning documents
4. **Approve** → Type /good to approve and lock the plan
5. **Plan** → Type /plan to generate execution plan
6. **Code** → Type /build to start coding
7. **Progress** → Type /progress to see how you're doing

## Agents

This project uses a hierarchical AI agency with 18 specialized agents:

- **Project Orchestrator** - Coordinates all agents and project execution
- **Product Manager** - Manages product requirements and roadmap
- **Engineering Lead** - Coordinates technical implementation
- **System Architect** - Designs system architecture
- **Frontend Lead** - Manages frontend development
- **Backend Lead** - Manages backend development
- **DevOps Engineer** - Handles infrastructure and deployment
- **Security Lead** - Ensures security best practices
- **Performance Engineer** - Optimizes performance
- **Design & UX Manager** - Manages design system
- **UI/UX Designer** - Creates user interfaces
- **QA & Reliability Manager** - Manages quality assurance
- **QA Engineer** - Tests and validates code
- **Release & Growth Manager** - Manages releases and growth
- **Release Captain** - Coordinates releases
- **Growth Coach** - Drives user growth
- **Documentation Lead** - Manages documentation
- **Documentation Writer** - Writes documentation

See .do/core/agents/ for full agent definitions (symlinked to .cursor/agents/).

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open cursor ./1 to start working with your AI agency.
If you selected multiple IDEs, repeat with your other preferred commands.

### Generate Source Code

Projects start with planning + documentation only. When you're ready to code, scaffold the stack with your preferred tool (e.g., `npx create-next-app`, `pnpm create`, `go mod init`). The legacy `scripts/boilerplate` helper has been removed, so bring or generate the starter code that matches your target stack.

## Next Steps

1. Type **/hello** for first-time welcome and tutorial (new users)
2. Type **/tell** to capture your project idea
3. Type **/meeting** to start discovery meeting with the team
4. Type **/write** to generate planning documents
4. Type **/good** to approve the plan
5. Type **/plan** to generate execution plan
6. Type **/build** to start coding
