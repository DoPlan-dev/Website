## FEELING CHECKLIST (Pro, Helpful, Friendly, Hopeful)

✓ **Professional:** High-quality graphics, consistent spacing, readable typography
✓ **Helpful:** Clear CTAs, answer objections, explain benefits, guides to resources
✓ **Friendly:** Warm colors, approachable illustrations, relatable copy, celebratory interactions
✓ **Hopeful:** Uplifting language ("Start shipping," "Your future," "Everything changes"), positive imagery (sunrise, growth, achievement)

Every section should trigger one of these feelings. Every illustration, icon, color, and word matters.
